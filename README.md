### 👋🏻 Hi, I’m Cam. I’m a digital product and strategy guy working at [Critical Mass](https://criticalmass.com/) in New York City. I help people solve problems and build useful, intuitive and delightful products and services.

I’m not a “real” developer by any stretch of the imagination, but I do enjoy noodling around with Python (mostly Django, but also some other bits and pieces), and know just enough HTML, CSS/SASS and Javascript to be dangerous. You _really_ don't want to hire me to write production code.

#### 📫 Get in touch

I play with web stuff at <a href="https://campegg.com/" rel="me">campegg.com</a>, or you can (very infrequently) find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/campegg" rel="me">Twitter<a/>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@campegg" rel="me">Mastodon</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/campegg" rel="me">LinkedIn</a>. If you want to kick it old-school, you can also [email](mailto:cam@campegg.com) me.
