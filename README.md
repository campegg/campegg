### 👋🏻 Hi, I’m Cam. I’m a digital product and strategy guy working at [Critical Mass](https://criticalmass.com/) in New York City. I help people solve problems and build useful, intuitive and delightful products and services.

I’m not a “real” developer by any stretch of the imagination, but I do enjoy noodling around with Python (mostly Django, but also some other bits and pieces), and know just enough HTML, CSS/SASS and Javascript to be dangerous. You _really_ don't want to hire me to write production code.

#### 📫 Get in touch

I play with web stuff at [campegg.com](https://campegg.com/), or you can (very infrequently) find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/campegg) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/campegg). If you want to kick it old-school, you can also [email](mailto:cam@campegg.com) me.
