### 👋🏻 Hi, I’m Cam. I’m a digital product and strategy guy working at [Critical Mass](https://criticalmass.com/) in New York City. I help people solve problems and build useful, intuitive and delightful products and services.

I’m not a “real” developer by any stretch of the imagination, but I do enjoy noodling around with Python (mostly Django, but also some other bits and pieces), and know just enough HTML, CSS/SASS and Javascript to be dangerous. I’m currently messing about with React and Gatsby as well, because I want to see what all the fuss is about. You _really_ don't want to hire me to write production code.
