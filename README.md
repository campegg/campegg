**👋🏻 Hi, I’m Cam.** I’m not a “real” developer by any stretch of the imagination, but I do enjoy noodling around with Python (mostly Django, but also some other bits and pieces), and know just enough HTML, CSS/SASS and Javascript to be dangerous. You _really_ don't want to hire me to write production code.
